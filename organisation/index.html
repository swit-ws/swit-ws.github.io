    <p><strong>Dr. Maria Maleshkova</strong> is a postdoctoral researcher at the Karlsruhe Service Research Institute (KSRI) and the Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Her research work covers Web of Things (WoT) and semantics-based data integration topics, as well as work in the area of the semantic description of Web APIs, RESTful services and their joint use with Linked Data. Prior to that she was a Research Associate and a PhD student at the Knowledge Media Institute (KMi) at the Open University, where she worked on projects in the domain of SOA and Web Services.</p>

    <p><strong>Dr. Muhammad Intizar Ali</strong> is an Adjunct Lecturer, Research Fellow and Research Unit Leader of Reasoning, Querying, and IoT Data Analytics Unit at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, National University of Ireland, Galway. His research interests include Semantic Web, Data Integration, Internet of Things (IoT), Linked Data, Federated Query Processing, Stream Query Processing and Optimal Query Processing over large scale distributed data sources. He is also actively participating in W3C efforts for standardization in RDF Stream Processing Community Group. Dr. Ali obtained his Ph.D. (with distinction) from Vienna University of Technology, Austria in 2011.</p>


    <p><strong>Dr. Freddy Lecue</strong> (PhD 2008, Habilitation 2015) is a principal scientist and research manager in large scale reasoning Systems in Accenture Technology Labs, Dublin - Ireland. He is also a research associate at INRIA, in WIMMICS, Sophia Antipolis - France. Before joining Accenture as a principal scientist and research manager in large scale reasoning system in January 2016, he was a research scientist and lead investigator in large scale reasoning systems at IBM Research - Ireland. His research area is at the frontier of learning, reasoning systems, and Internet of Things with a focus on smart enterprise and city applications (in Dublin - Ireland, Bologna - Italy, Miami - USA and Rio - Brazil).</p>

    <p><strong>Sebastian Bader</strong> is a research associate at the Karlsruhe Service Research Institute (KSRI) and the Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. His research focuses on Data Integration, the Internet of Things and how Semantic Web Technologies can contribute to the digital transformation. He is interested in Web Components, Linked Data and current developments of cyper-physical systems and the industrial internet.
